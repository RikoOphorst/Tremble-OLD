	* @brief A Pool Allocator class
	*
	* A pool allocator class, as the name suggests, keeps a pool of objects. All objects have to be the same size. Size is specified during the allocator constructor.
	* A pool allocator is faster than a more general-purpose free list allocator, and should be used if possible
	* It is fast when it comes to allocation or deallocation, however it takes time to construct it. Construction time depends on the size of the allocator
